This Project automates ground and areial-surveillance, reducing the downtime required for physical monitoring. 
It ca be incorporated into  a Closed Circuit TV archutecture to automate tracking and identification of threats to critical assets.
To get started, get familiar with relevant CLI, as well as python libraries required for the imported model handling.
The Project utilzes the open source hugging-face model for object classification, generating automated detailed descriptio of camera frames. 
The Project is designed to flag certain objects classified as threats and automatically alert person of interest via a snap report.
The various libraries utilized are as follows:
ultralytics==8.2.103
opencv-python>=4.8.0.76
numpy>=1.24.0
requests>=2.31.0
gTTS>=2.5.1
playsound==1.2.2
